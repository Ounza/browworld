              <p>
                Microblading is creating 3D hair like strokes using microfine
                needles. This technique is suitable for who have plenty of
                existing hair to blend with the created strokes. Great for those
                who have good amount of hair and want more volume. For those who
                have little to no hair, it’s not recommended as the strokes will
                not blend naturally. Suitable for dry or normal skin. If you
                have oily skin, please opt for Ombré Brows. Lasts upto 24
                Months.

                The Ombre Brows is a semi-permanent technique for clients who

                shaded brow pencil look. Once healed, it is more natural looking
                than solid color.Whether you are looking for a light soft
                shading or show-stopping bold brows, this technique can be
                customized according to your desire. Lasts upto 3 years.

          </ul>
          <h2>After Treatment</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Immediately after the procedure, brows will appear dark and very
              defined before the scabbing phase for a couple of days. However,
              the thickness will subside gradually day by day.
            </li>
            <li>
              There may be whiteness or blanching around the area, which is
              perfectly normal and will subside within 12 hours. In case you
              find any lymphatic fluid or blood weeping you can gently clean the
              area with cool boiled water and gauze, blotting gently dry to
              remove any moisture.
            </li>
            <li>
              Redness and burning sensation is normal and should subside by the
              following day completely. If the area feels unbearable to you,
              please use a clean ice pack for comfort.
            </li>
            <li>
              You will go through three healing phases: 1-heal, 2-peel and
              3-fade.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the brow area starts to peel, it will appear flaky and
              unappealing. The area may feel a bit dry. Do not pick or pull at
              the treated area as it will result in pigment loss
            </li>
            <li>
              Once all scabs have fully fallen off completely and naturally,
              healed results should appear 20-30% lighter in color and about 15%
              smaller in size from the initial. Kindly consider using a
              waterproof total sunblock when going out in the sun to stop the
              color fading.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Touch Ups</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>1st touch up after 4-8 weeks for free</li>
            <li>2nd touch up after 8-12 months @ Ksh 7500</li>
            <li>3rd touch up after 12-24 months @ Ksh 15,000</li>
            <li>
              Above 24 months the full amount for the chosen procedure is
              payable.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Kindly note</h2>
          <p>
            Permanent cosmetic enhancements normally require multiple
            application sessions. To achieve the best results, you will be
            required to return for at least one control procedure after the
            initial application. Be prepared for the color intensity to be
            significantly sharper and darker immediately after the procedure.
            This will subside and become softer as the skin heals. This process
            can take up to 14 days.
